# Origination Terminal

# Description

## Interface for creating and managing token sale listings

Projects can use the Origination Terminal to create a token listing and select any number of sale options, such as
specifying vesting terms, whitelisting addresses, a reserve amount, a sliding price scale (ascending and descending).

Listings created through this interface will pay a small fee for the listing, and a small percentage for any token sale.
